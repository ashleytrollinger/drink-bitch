## Introduction

Drink B*tch is a web application that uses https://opentdb.com/ to generate diffferent quizzes based off a users input of quiz length, category, and difficulty. Once the unique API key is generated and the quiz populates users have 30 seconds to answer each question. If they get the question wrong or the time runs out the user is redirected to a wheel they can spin to determine how much to drink. The application was developed as a birthday present to my friend but I created it because we were wanting a quiz website that did not exist.

## Future Development
I would like to create my own API to have full control over the questions being generated and loaded into the quiz to ensure correctness and correlation. More games would be ideal to give users more options as well as adding a footer to direct users to my portfolio and socials.
